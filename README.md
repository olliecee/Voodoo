# Voodoo
[![Build Status][travis-badge]][travis-badge-url]

Voodoo is a health and wellness tracking app that collects day-to-day information on pains (soreness, ache, rash, etc). Using data trends to solve potential causes of reoccurring stress or trauma as well as suggesting solutions.

This repository holds the Voodoo source code for the concept UI,
the foundation for most of what the application might turn out like and it is not a representation of the final product.

It's been extended with testing support the app can start tests immediately.

**This is not the perfect arrangement for any mobile application. It is not designed for production.
It exists primarily as a quick mobile application concept with learning and prototyping in Angular**

## Technologies Used in Voodoo

From time to time the Voodoo will add be enhanced with support for new features or to reflect
changes to the growing web development field. Note that if you download or clone the repository you'll need to restore 
dependencies.

Currently, the features that Voodoo contains are:
- Angular 2.4
- Bower
  - Normalize
  - jQuery
  - Tether (Bootstrap 4 dependency)
  - Bootstrap 4 RC4 (Alpha)
  - Animate.css
  - Wow.js
  - Font Awesome
- NPM
  - Gulp (concat, cssmin, uglify)
  - Rimraf
- NodeJS
- Express
- MongoDB

Now you can continue working on the new project.

## Prerequisites

Node.js and npm are essential to Angular development. 
    
<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node" target="_blank" title="Installing Node.js and updating npm">
Get it now</a> if it's not already installed on your machine.
 
**Verify that you are running at least node `v4.x.x` and npm `3.x.x`**
by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.
Older versions produce errors.

We recommend [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for managing multiple versions of node and npm.

### Delete _non-essential_ files (optional)

You can quickly delete the _non-essential_ files that concern testing and QuickStart repository maintenance
(***including all git-related artifacts*** such as the `.git` folder and `.gitignore`!)
by entering the following commands while in the project folder:

##### OS/X (bash)
```shell
xargs rm -rf < non-essential-files.osx.txt
rm src/app/*.spec*.ts
rm non-essential-files.osx.txt
```

##### Windows
```shell
for /f %i in (non-essential-files.txt) do del %i /F /S /Q
rd .git /s /q
rd e2e /s /q
```

## Install npm packages

> See npm and nvm version notes above

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

>Doesn't work in _Bash for Windows_ which does not support servers as of January, 2017.

The `npm start` command first compiles the application, 
then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the `lite-server`.
Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.

You're ready to write your application.

### npm scripts

We've captured many of the most useful commands in npm scripts defined in the `package.json`:

* `npm start` - runs the compiler and a server at the same time, both in "watch mode".
* `npm run build` - runs the TypeScript compiler once.
* `npm run build:w` - runs the TypeScript compiler in watch mode; the process keeps running, awaiting changes to TypeScript files and re-compiling when it sees them.
* `npm run serve` - runs the [lite-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lite-server), a light-weight, static file server, written and maintained by
[John Papa](https://github.com/johnpapa) and
[Christopher Martin](https://github.com/cgmartin)
with excellent support for Angular apps that use routing.

Here are the test related scripts:
* `npm test` - compiles, runs and watches the karma unit tests
* `npm run e2e` - compiles and run protractor e2e tests, written in Typescript (*e2e-spec.ts)

### Unit Tests
TypeScript unit-tests are usually in the `src/app` folder. Their filenames must end in `.spec.ts`.

Look for the example `src/app/app.component.spec.ts`.
Add more `.spec.ts` files as you wish; we configured karma to find them.

Run it with `npm test`

That command first compiles the application, then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the karma test-runner.
Both the compiler and the karma watch for (different) file changes.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.

Test-runner output appears in the terminal window.
We can update our app and our tests in real-time, keeping a weather eye on the console for broken tests.
Karma is occasionally confused and it is often necessary to shut down its browser or even shut the command down (`Ctrl-C`) and
restart it. No worries; it's pretty quick.

### End-to-end (E2E) Tests

E2E tests are in the `e2e` directory, side by side with the `src` folder.
Their filenames must end in `.e2e-spec.ts`.

Look for the example `e2e/app.e2e-spec.ts`.
Add more `.e2e-spec.js` files as you wish (although one usually suffices for small projects);
we configured Protractor to find them.

Thereafter, run them with `npm run e2e`.

That command first compiles, then simultaneously starts the `lite-server` at `localhost:8080`
and launches Protractor.  

The pass/fail test results appear at the bottom of the terminal window.
A custom reporter (see `protractor.config.js`) generates a  `./_test-output/protractor-results.txt` file
which is easier to read; this file is excluded from source control.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.
